# veloGui - A velocity template tester
fork of pipoware.org veloGUI

I DO NOT OWN this project, and it is only forked here because I had problem with source and wanted to refector a bit.
Please find more details on the original post - http://pipoware.free.fr/velogui/#tryit

Also you can run the original application directly (its hosted as webstart by OP) without downloading anything, for that use the command below
with any terminal or CMD-
```bash
javaws http://pipoware.free.fr/velogui/VeloGUI.jnlp
```
